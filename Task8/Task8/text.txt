Shrek is an anti-social (and) (highly-territorial) (green) ogre who loves the
solitude of his swamp. His ((life)) is interrupted after the dwarfish Lord Farquaad
of Duloc unknowingly exiles a vast number of fairy-tale creatures to Shrek's swamp. Angered by the intrusion,
he decides to visit Farquaad and demand they be moved elsewhere. He reluctantly allows the
talkative Donkey, who was exiled as well, to tag along and guide him to Duloc.
